    <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
    <p>
      I work with youth and adults who feel weighed down by challenges such as anxiety, depression, ADHD,
      sleep difficulties, self-esteem concerns, grief, or the emotional impact of cancer and perimenopause.
      Many people I see are functioning on the outside while feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or exhausted
      internally—often managing racing thoughts, low mood, poor sleep, or the strain of high responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also support medical professionals, first responders, and business executives who are carrying
      significant stress while continuing to show up for others.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we can slow things down and understand
      what is happening beneath the surface. I see medication as one possible tool—not a requirement,
      and never the whole answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work collaboratively to clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with
      your values, preferences, and lived experience. My focus is on helping you feel more like yourself
      again, at a pace that feels manageable and respectful.
