                    <h3>Adolescents</h3>
                    <p>The teenage years carry real pressure, and early support can make a significant difference. This is a space where teenagers can talk through what is going on without judgment, and where parents can get guidance figuring out how to help.</p>

                    <h3>Female Physiology</h3>
                    <p>From adolescence through perimenopause, women's mental health is shaped by biology in ways that are frequently not considered. I integrate the hormonal cycle into assessment and treatment from the start, drawing on evidence grounded in female physiology.</p>

    <p>My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we work collaboratively to sift through your lived experience. We clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with your values. Your needs and goals shape how we work together.</p>
    <p>The tools depend on what fits: medication, therapy, coaching, and education. Finding relief. Laughter. Looking forward and sometimes back. Sleep, nutrition, and movement are always part of the picture. And when the time is right, deprescribing too.</p>
