    <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
    <p>
      I work with youth and adults who feel weighed down by challenges such as anxiety, depression,
      ADHD, sleep difficulties, self-esteem concerns, grief, or the emotional impact of cancer and
      perimenopause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people I see are functioning on the outside while feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or exhausted
      internally—often managing racing thoughts, low mood, poor sleep, or the strain of high responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also support medical professionals, first responders, and business executives who are carrying
      significant stress while continuing to show up for others.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we can slow things down and better understand
      what is happening beneath the surface. Medication may be one tool we consider, but it is never
      required and never the whole answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work collaboratively to clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with your
      values and lived experience, moving at a pace that feels manageable and respectful.
