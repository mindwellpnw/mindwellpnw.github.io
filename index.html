          <h2>Are We a Good Fit?</h2>
          <p>
            My clients range from teenagers to adults at various points in life. Some are navigating a clear difficulty; others simply know that something feels off and want support figuring out why. A number of them are capable, driven people who appear fine from the outside but are running on empty underneath. Others are managing a diagnosis, a health challenge, or a transition that has shifted their footing.

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we can slow things down and better understand
        what is happening beneath the surface. Medication may be one tool we consider, but it is never required
        and never the whole answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work collaboratively to clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with your values
        and lived experience, moving at a pace that feels manageable and respectful.
