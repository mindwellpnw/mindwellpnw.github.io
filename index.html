          <h2>Are We a Good Fit?</h2>
          <p>My clients range from teenagers to adults facing some of the more challenging periods of their lives. 
            You may be navigating a clear difficulty; alternatively maybe something simply feels off and want 
            support figuring out why.
Do you worry in a way that feels impossible to turn off?
Have things you used to enjoy started to feel flat or not worth the effort?
Has concentrating or following through become harder than it used to be?
Do you wake up tired no matter how much you slept?
Do you notice tension in your body, a tight chest or a stomach that is always slightly knotted?
Does your hormonal cycle feel like it is impacting your quality of life?

    <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>

    <div class="services">
      <div class="svc svc-full">
        <h3>ADHD, Anxiety &amp; Depression</h3>
        <p>You might feel a low-grade dread you cannot explain, an irritability that surprises you, or 
          a heaviness that makes getting through the day feel like more effort than it should. 
          Perhaps things that once brought you pleasure no longer do, or you find yourself withdrawing and going 
          through the motions without really being present. You might struggle to quiet your mind,
          lose track of conversations, or feel behind no matter how hard you work, cycling between bursts of 
          productivity and complete shutdown. Getting the right assessment makes all the difference. 
          We work to untangle what is actually going on and build a plan that addresses the full picture.</p>
      </div>
<div class="svc">
        <h3>Adolescents</h3>
        <p><em>The teenage years carry real pressure, and early support can make a significant difference.</em> 
          This is a space where teenagers can talk through what is going on without judgment, and where parents can get guidance figuring out how to help.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="svc">
        <h3>Female Physiology</h3>
        <p><em>From adolescence through perimenopause, women's mental health is shaped by biology in ways that are frequently not considered.</em> 
          I integrate the hormonal cycle into assessment and treatment from the start, drawing on evidence grounded in female physiology.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3> Athletes &amp; Sports Performance</h3>
        <p><em>The mental demands of sport are just as taxing as the physical ones.</em> Whether the goal is sharper performance, 
          steadier recovery, or figuring out who you are outside of your sport, that is where we focus.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3>High-Stress Roles: First Responders, Medical Professionals & Executives</h3>
        <p><em>Certain environments are built around high stakes, relentless pace, where showing signs of struggle is not an option.</em> 
          You do not have to be in crisis for this to be worth addressing.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we can slow things down and better understand
        what is happening beneath the surface. Medication may be one tool we consider, but it is never required
        and never the whole answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work collaboratively to clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with your values
        and lived experience, moving at a pace that feels manageable and respectful.
