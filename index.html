          <h2>Are We a Good Fit?</h2>
          <p>
            My clients range from teenagers to adults at various points in life. Some are navigating a clear difficulty; 
            others simply know that something feels off and want support figuring out why. A number of them are capable, 
            driven people who appear fine from the outside but are running on empty underneath. Others are managing a diagnosis, 
            a health challenge, or a transition that has shifted their footing.

    <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>

    <div class="services">
      <div class="svc">
        <h3>ADHD, Anxiety &amp; Depression</h3>
        <p>You might feel a low-grade dread you cannot explain, an irritability that surprises you, or 
          a heaviness that makes getting through the day feel like more effort than it should. 
          Perhaps things that once brought you pleasure no longer do, or you find yourself withdrawing and going 
          through the motions without really being present. You might also struggle to quiet your mind,
          lose track of conversations, or feel behind no matter how hard you work, cycling between bursts of 
          productivity and complete shutdown. Getting the right assessment makes all the difference. 
          We work to untangle what is actually going on and build a plan that addresses the full picture.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3>Female Physiology</h3>
        <p>From adolescence through perimenopause, women's mental health is shaped
          by biology in ways that are frequently not considered. Fluctuations across the menstrual cycle 
          affect mood, energy, focus, and overall well-being in ways that are real and measurable. 
          I  integrate the hormonal cycle into assessment and treatment from the start, 
          drawing on evidence grounded in female physiology rather than the 
          traditional model of applying male-centric research to everyone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3> Athletes &amp; Sports Performance</h3>
        <p>For many athletes, the mental demands of their sport are just as taxing as the physical ones. 
          Performance anxiety, perfectionism, and the weight of expectations can be hard to address in a 
          culture that prizes winning above all else. Athletes often carry significant pressure around performance,
          playing time, team dynamics, and what their sport means to their sense of self. Injury, burnout, and the 
          transition out of sport can hit harder than expected. I work with athletes whether the goal is 
          sharper performance, steadier recovery, or figuring out who you are outside of your sport.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3>High-Stress Roles & Medical Professionals</h3>
        <p>Some people operate in environments where the stakes are high, the pace is relentless, and showing signs of 
          struggle is not an option. First responders and medical professionals carry the cumulative weight of what they 
          witness and manage on the job. Executives leading organizations navigate high-stakes decisions, organizational 
          pressure, and often a surprising degree of professional isolation. What these roles share is a culture that 
          rewards output and treats rest as a liability. Over time, sleep suffers, irritability builds, mood becomes harder to 
          regulate, and being present outside of work feels out of reach. You do not have to be in crisis for this to be worth addressing.
</p>
      </div>

      <div class="svc">
        <h3>Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>A cancer diagnosis can reshape every aspect of daily life. Anxiety about the future, grief over what has changed, 
          and the psychological weight of treatment can be as debilitating as the physical demands. Fear, anger, and a sense of 
          loss may surface in ways that feel unexpected. Cognitive changes from treatment can affect memory and concentration. 
          Relationships and identity can shift in ways that are hard to prepare for. 
          I support the mental health of individuals at any stage, from diagnosis through treatment and into survivorship.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My role is to offer a steady, non-judgmental space where we can slow things down and better understand
        what is happening beneath the surface. Medication may be one tool we consider, but it is never required
        and never the whole answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work collaboratively to clarify goals, explore options, and create a plan that aligns with your values
        and lived experience, moving at a pace that feels manageable and respectful.
